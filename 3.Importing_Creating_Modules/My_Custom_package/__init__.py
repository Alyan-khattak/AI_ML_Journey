"""
__init__.py is a special file used inside a folder to tell python
-->> This Folder is a python package

"""

# When you want to create a custom package -->> Make sure to include init.py file in it ( it could be empty)
# then make your own Modules inside that Package and can import it in another files ( Here I am making Alyan_Maths.py)


## WE can create a sub pkg by making a folder in this directory and follow the same method ( make init.py and ur modules)
