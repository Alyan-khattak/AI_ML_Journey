# AI & Machine Learning – Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is a **live learning log** of my journey into **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

I am currently learning AI/ML step by step, and I commit whatever I learn here. 
The goal is to track progress, practice concepts, and build a strong foundation over time.


Each notebook represents something I learned or practiced on a specific day/topic.

## 🎯 Why this repo?

- To stay consistent
- To build learning in public
- To revise concepts easily
- To show my AI/ML learning journey over time

This is **not a polished project repo**, but a **learning-focused repository**.

## 📈 Status

🔄 **Ongoing** — I update this repo regularly as I learn new concepts.
